## Problem statement

We need to develop a Q/A chatbot prototype that can effectively address questions related to this publication. This prototype should be implemented in Python using an open-source Large Language Model (LLM). Additionally, we require a comprehensive evaluation approach to assess the chatbot's performance.

Furthermore, review this research and answer the following questions:
1. What are the 3 takeaways for this research?
2. How could this research be important for Humana?
3. How can you include this research into your Q/A chatbot?

## Proposed Solution

To address this challenge, we propose the following solution:

1. Prototype Development:
    - [x] Technology Stack: Implement the chatbot in Python using an open-source LLM.
    - [ ] Functionality: Ensure the chatbot can handle a wide range of questions related to the publication, providing accurate and contextually relevant answers.
2. Evaluation Approach:
    - [ ] Business Metrics: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response accuracy, user satisfaction, and response time.
    - [ ] Testing: Conduct extensive testing with a diverse set of queries to evaluate the chatbot's performance.
    - [ ] Continuous Improvement: Establish a process for ongoing evaluation and refinement based on user feedback and performance data.
3. Assumptions:
    - Data Availability: Assume access to the publication's content.
    - [ ] User Base: Consider a diverse user base with varying levels of familiarity with the publication.
4. Reproducibility:
    - [ ] Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation of the development process, including code, data sources, and evaluation methods.
    - [ ] Open Source: Share the prototype and related resources on a platform such as GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

By developing this Q/A chatbot prototype, we aim to demonstrate our commitment to innovation and customer-centric solutions. We look forward to reviewing the initial prototype and exploring its potential. Final advice, please make the appropriate assumptions.
