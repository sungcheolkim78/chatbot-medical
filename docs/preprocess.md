# PDF Text Extraction Methods for Medical Publications

## Overview
This document outlines various approaches attempted for extracting text from medical PDF publications, with a focus on maintaining structural integrity and content accuracy.

## Traditional Extraction Methods

### Attempted Libraries
1. **PyPDF**: Basic PDF text extraction
2. **Unstructured**: Advanced document parsing
3. **Docling**: Document processing framework

### Limitations
The conventional text extraction methods proved insufficient for our use case due to:
- Poor preservation of document structure
- Inadequate handling of complex layouts
- Suboptimal text chunking affecting downstream tasks
- Limited support for tables and figures

While OCR and element-wise analysis showed potential, they required complex implementation and additional processing steps.

## Multi-modal Approach Using Claude 3.7 Sonnet

### Implementation
We implemented a more effective solution using Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a multi-modal language model capable of:
- Understanding document layout and structure
- Preserving positional relationships between elements
- Extracting text while maintaining context
- Converting content to structured markdown format

### Extraction Process
The model was prompted with the following instruction:
```
You are a medical doctor specializing in breast cancer. Given a PDF file, convert it 
into a Markdown file, and for the figures, please add sections with detailed descriptions. 
Please translate the contents as close as possible to the original PDF files if possible.
```

### Results
The multi-modal approach successfully:
- Preserved original document structure
- Maintained content accuracy
- Included detailed figure descriptions
- Generated well-formatted markdown output

## Repository Contents

### Files
- `knowledge/slamon1978.pdf`: Original publication
- `knowledge/slamon1987_short.pdf`: Condensed version (removed unnecessary pages)
- `knowledge/slamon1987_claude.md`: Extracted markdown content

## Implementation Notes

### Current Setup
- Extraction performed using Anthropic's desktop application
- Process can be automated using Anthropic's API for batch processing

### Future Improvements
- API integration for automated processing
- Batch processing capabilities
- Custom prompt engineering for specific document types
