The best-known oncogene in breast cancer is HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2), which is responsible for about 20% of all breast cancers. It encodes a protein involved in cell growth and division, and its amplification or mutation can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. The expression of HER2 was first identified as an oncogene in 1987 by researcher David Carter. In addition to its role in breast cancer, HER2 has also been implicated in other types of cancer, including gastric and ovarian cancers. The development of targeted therapies against HER2, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin), has significantly improved treatment outcomes for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Today, there are several targeted therapies available for use, including pertuzumab (Perjeta) and neratinib (Nerlynx). Ongoing research continues to explore new ways to target HER2 and other oncogenes in breast cancer, with the goal of developing more effective and personalized treatments.
