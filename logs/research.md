Here are the 10 most relevant points about the best-known oncogene in breast cancer:


• **HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2)** is the best-known oncogene in breast cancer. It is responsible for about 20% of all breast cancers.

• HER2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell growth and division. In some cases, this protein can be overexpressed or mutated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.

• The amplification of the HER2 gene is often associated with more aggressive forms of breast cancer.

• The expression of HER2 was first identified as an oncogene in 1987 by researcher David Carter.

• In addition to its role in breast cancer, HER2 has also been implicated in other types of cancer, including gastric and ovarian cancers.

• The development of targeted therapies against HER2, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin), has significantly improved treatment outcomes for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

• Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the HER2 protein, preventing its interaction with other proteins and thereby inhibiting tumor growth.

• The approval of trastuzumab by the FDA in 1998 marked a major breakthrough in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.

• Today, there are several targeted therapies against HER2 available for use, including pertuzumab (Perjeta) and neratinib (Nerlynx).

• Ongoing research continues to explore new ways to target HER2 and other oncogenes in breast cancer, with the goal of developing more effective and personalized treatments.
