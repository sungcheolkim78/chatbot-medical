It appears that you have provided a snippet of text from a scientific article, specifically a study about the HER-2/neu gene in breast cancer. The text describes the association between HER-2/neu amplification and various disease parameters in 103 breast tumors.

To provide a meaningful response, I'll attempt to summarize the key findings presented in this text:

**Main Findings:**

1. **Frequency of HER-2/neu Amplification**: Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene occurs relatively frequently in breast cancer.
2. **Association with Disease Relapse and Overall Patient Survival**: HER-2/neu amplification is associated with disease relapse and overall patient survival.

**Additional Context:**

1. **Importance of Breast Cancer Prognosis Factors**: The size of the primary tumor, stage of disease at diagnosis, hormonal receptor status, and number of axillary lymph nodes involved with disease are known to be important in determining prognosis for individual patients.
2. **Large Series of Human Primary Breast Cancers Evaluated**: The study evaluated tissue from 189 separate breast malignancies that were part of a larger breast cancer study.

**Conclusion:**

The text describes the frequency and implications of HER-2/neu amplification in breast cancer, highlighting its association with disease relapse and overall patient survival. This information is crucial for understanding the prognostic factors in breast cancer and may inform treatment decisions.
