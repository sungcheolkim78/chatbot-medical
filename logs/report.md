It seems like we've got a science-y text here. Let's break down what's going on.

**The Problem:**

You need to answer a question about a study related to breast cancer, HER-2/neu gene amplification, and survival rates.

**The Text:**

This is a scientific article discussing the relationship between HER-2/neu gene amplification and survival rates in breast cancer patients. The authors are analyzing data from 189 breast cancer patients who had undergone mastectomy and were treated with various therapies.

**Key Points:**

1. The study found that HER-2/neu gene amplification was associated with a higher likelihood of disease recurrence and shorter overall survival.
2. Patients with HER-2/neu amplification had a significantly shorter time to relapse (62 months) compared to those without amplification (median follow-up time was 47 months).
3. The authors performed statistical analyses and found that HER-2/neu amplification was the most significant predictor of disease recurrence and overall survival, even when other prognostic factors were taken into account.
4. Rearrangement of the HER-2/neu gene was rare in this study population.

**Your Task:**

Based on the text, what is your Final Answer regarding the relationship between HER-2/neu gene amplification and survival rates in breast cancer patients?

Please provide a concise answer in the format: "The Final Answer is [answer]."
