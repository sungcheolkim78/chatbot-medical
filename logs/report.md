It seems like we've got a complex research paper excerpt here!

To provide a final answer, I'll need to summarize the key points. However, please note that there's no specific question being asked in this text.

That being said, let's highlight some important findings:

1. The study found a strong correlation between HER-2/neu amplification and disease behavior in breast cancer patients.
2. Patients with any amplification of the HER-2/neu gene had a significantly shorter time to relapse and overall survival compared to those without amplification.
3. Univariate survival analysis showed that HER-2/neu amplification was superior to other prognostic factors, except for the number of positive nodes, in predicting time to relapse and overall survival.

If I had to give a "final answer" based on this excerpt, I'd say:

**The amplification of the HER-2/neu gene is a significant predictor of disease behavior in breast cancer patients.**

Please let me know if you have any specific questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
