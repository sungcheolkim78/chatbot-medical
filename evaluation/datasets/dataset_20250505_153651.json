    "answer": "According to the excerpt, the study found that the minor capsid peptide VP4 is completely internal in Mengo virus but its association with the other capsid proteins is substantially different from that in rhino- or poliovirus. Specifically, the paper states: 'The minor capsid peptide, VP 4, is completely intenal in Mengo virus, but its association with the other capsid proteis is substantially different from that in rhino-or poliovirus.' This demonstrates that while VP4 is internal in Mengo virus, its interactions with other capsid proteins differ from those in other picornaviruses like rhinovirus and poliovirus.",
