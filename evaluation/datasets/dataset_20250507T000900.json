    "question": "What novel gene was identified through transfection studies with DNA from chemically induced rat neuroglioblastomas, and how is it related to the c-erbb proto-oncogene?",
    "answer": "The excerpt identifies a novel transforming gene called neu, which was shown to be related to, but distinct from, the c-erbb proto-oncogene. Specifically, the paper states: 'this gene, called neu, was shown to be related to, but distinct from, the c - erbb proto - oncogene.' This demonstrates that while neu shares similarities with c-erbb, it represents a unique entity within the family of proto-oncogenes.",
    "source": "'this gene, called neu, was shown to be related to, but distinct from, the c - erbb proto - oncogene.'",
    "full_context": "[Chunk 5] ##bb, are members of the tyrosine - specific protein kinase family to which many proto - oncogenes belong. recently, a novel transforming gene was identified as a result of transfection studies with dna from chemically induced rat neurogliobalstomas. this gene, called neu, was shown to be related to, but distinct from, the c - erbb proto - oncogene. by means of v - erbb and human egfr as probes to screen human genomic and complementary dna ( cdna ) libraries, two other groups independently isolated human erbb - related genes that they called her - 2 and c - erbb - 2. subsequent sequence analysis and chromosomal mapping studies revealed all",
