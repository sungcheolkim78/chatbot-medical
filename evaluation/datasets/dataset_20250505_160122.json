    "question": "What is the finding about the correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and breast cancer prognosis described in the excerpt?",
    "answer": "According to the excerpt, the study found that amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was associated with worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. Specifically, the paper states: 'To determine if amplification of HER-2/neu was independent of other known prognostic factors in predicting disease behavior, multivariate survival analyses were performed on the 86 nodepositive cases. Amplification of the gene continued to be a strong prognostic factor, providing additional and independent predictive information on both time to relapse and overall survival in these'. This demonstrates that HER-2/neu gene amplification was correlated with shorter time to relapse and reduced overall survival, even after accounting for other prognostic factors.",

    "question": "How was the amplification of the HER-2/neu gene categorized in the study, and what methodological consideration influenced this categorization?",
    "answer": "The amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was categorized into groups based on copy number: single copy, 2 to 5 copies, 5 to 20 copies, and greater than 20 copies. The methodology of Southern blotting influenced this categorization, as the efficiency of transfer depends on the molecular weight of the DNA fragments. The excerpt states: \"Individual tumors were assigned to groups containing a single copy, 2 to 5 copies, 5 to 20 copies, and greater than 20 copies of the HER-2/neu gene (Fig. 1).\"  This categorization, combined with the mention of ensuring \"equivalent amounts of high molecular weight DNA (Fig. 2 B),\" suggests the researchers considered the potential bias of smaller fragments transferring more efficiently during Southern blotting when analyzing gene amplification.",
