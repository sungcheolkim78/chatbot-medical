    "answer": "The excerpt suggests a correlation between the number of HER-2/neu amplifications and the number of positive lymph nodes in human breast cancer. For instance, when there is a single copy of the HER-2/neu oncogene, the number of positive lymph nodes is 30. However, when there are more than 20 copies, the number of positive lymph nodes is only 1. This suggests that the number of positive lymph nodes decreases as the number of HER-2/neu amplifications increases.",
